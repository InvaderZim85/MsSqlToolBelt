# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Should a security vulnerability occur / be detected in a version, the affected version will be replaced by a new version. The old version (with security vulnerability) is then removed from the release to minimize the risk of further use.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, you can inform us as follows via [Security > Advisories](https://github.com/InvaderZim85/MsSqlToolBelt/security/advisories).
